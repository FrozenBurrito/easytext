|0|You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.|I have good news! The thing you were worried about happening when I started this project didn't happen. I got here yesterday and my first job is to let my sister know I'm okay and feeling more and more confident that my project will be successful.|
|1|I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.|I am really far away from London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold wind on my face that comes from the northern regions. It makes me feel excited and happy. Can you understand this feeling? This wind is a preview of the icy places I am heading towards. This wind gives me hope and makes my daydreams more intense and detailed. I try to believe that the North Pole is a freezing and desolate place, but in my imagination, it is a beautiful and delightful region. There, Margaret, the sun is always visible, just barely above the horizon, and it shines all the time. I trust what earlier explorers have said about this. In that place, there is no snow or frost, and we can sail on a calm sea to a land that is more extraordinary and beautiful than any other place known. The things and the features there may be unlike anything seen before, just like the things we see in space. What wonders might we find in a place that has never-ending light? I might discover the amazing power that attracts compass needles and can help us learn more about the sky. I will satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world that has never been visited before, and I may walk on land where no human has ever been. These are the things that make me want to start this hard journey without being scared of danger or death. It's like when a child happily gets on a boat with friends and goes on a trip to explore their local river. But even if all my ideas turn out to be wrong, you can't argue that I will be doing something incredibly important for all people, even for future generations. I will discover a way near the North Pole to get to places that currently take many months to reach, or I will figure out the secret behind magnets. If that's even possible, it can only be done by a journey like the one I am planning.|
|2|These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.|These thoughts have calmed me down and made me feel excited. It's nice to have a goal or something to focus on because it helps me feel peaceful. As a kid, I loved reading books about people going on voyages to the North Pacific Ocean. My uncle had a whole library of books about explorers. Even though my education wasn't the best, I loved reading those books all the time. I was sad when I found out that my dad didn't want me to go on a ship, like my uncle did.|
|3|These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.|I stopped dreaming about being a great writer when I read the inspiring poems of other famous writers. I wanted to be a poet too and thought I could be as famous as Homer and Shakespeare. But things didn't go as planned and I felt really sad about it. But then, I got a lot of money from my cousin and I started thinking about being a writer again.|
|4|Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.|It has been six years since I decided to start what I am doing now. I can still remember the exact moment when I made up my mind to do this big thing. I began by making my body get used to tough things. I went with the people who hunt whales on many trips to the North Sea. I willingly endured being very cold, not having enough food, being very thirsty, and not getting much sleep. During the day, I often worked harder than the regular sailors, and at night, I studied math, medicine, and other kinds of science that a sailor like me could use. Twice, I actually got a job as the second-in-command on a ship that hunts whales in Greenland, and I did a fantastic job. I have to admit that I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second most important job on the ship and begged me to stay with them, because he thought I was so valuable.|
|5|And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.|And now, my dear Margaret, don't you think I deserve to achieve something important? I could have lived a comfortable and luxurious life, but I chose fame and honor over the tempting opportunities that money offered me. I wish someone would give me some encouragement! I am brave and determined, but sometimes my hopes go up and down, and I feel sad. I am going on a long and hard journey, where I will need a lot of strength. I have to not only lift the spirits of others, but also keep my own spirits up when they are down.|
|6|This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.|This is a really good time to travel in Russia. They go fast on their sleds over the snow, and it feels nice. I think it's even better than riding in an English stagecoach. It's not too cold if you wear warm fur clothes. I've already started wearing them because it's very different to be walking around versus sitting for hours without moving, which can make your blood freeze. I don't want to risk my life on the road between St. Petersburg and Archangel.|
|7|I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.|I will leave for the other town in two weeks or three weeks from now. I plan to rent a boat there by paying an insurance fee for the owner. I will also hire some sailors who are experienced in catching whales. I won't set sail until June. But I don't know when I will come back. It's hard to say. If I do well, it may take many months or even years before we can see each other again. If I don't do well, you might see me again soon, or maybe never.|
|8|Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness. Your affectionate brother, R. Walton|Goodbye, my dear and wonderful Margaret. I hope that you receive many blessings from heaven. Please, keep me safe so that I can thank you for all the love and kindness you have shown me. Your loving brother, R. Walton.|
